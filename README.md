# Database Design Project

## Summary

This database project is for the course MET CS669 at Boston University, completed within 5 weeks. The project includes all elements of modern industry-grade relational databases, such as ERDs, normalization, indexes, stored procedures, triggers, advanced queries, and more. The DB and data is geared towards training metrics associated with typical online learning platforms such as courses and certifications, but can be generalized for any use case involving employee data.
